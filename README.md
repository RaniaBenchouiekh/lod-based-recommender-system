# LODS Recommender System
**LODS RS**, a plateform offering a LODS based recommender system. Recommends everything within the DBpedia Dataset.

## Motivation
The decentralized plateform **LODS RS** was created in order to calculate similarity scores between different data types using the [LODS mesure](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7536467).
